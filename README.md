# Benji's Animal Shelter

- Benji's Animal Shelter is the final project created at the Bits of Good Bootcamp. 
- It uses React for its frontend interface, stores data in a MongoDB databse and uses a ExpressJS backend to fetch this data and provide it to the frontend.
- The primary goal of the project is to maintain an inventory of pets waiting to be apodted. Changes to the adoption status of a pet has to be reflected in the backend and the frontend dynamically processes data provided to it.
- The frontend also uses custom CSS and heavily relies on flexbox.
